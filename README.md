## 🎓 Education
**Monash University**  
Bachelor of Applied Data Science  
Feb 2021 - Jun 2024

Throughout this degree, I acquired valuable skills in R and Python, as well as skills in data analysis, data visualization, machine learning modeling, and mathematical modeling. Additionally, I have been able to present complex data science projects and results in a clear and concise manner. These skills have prepared me to tackle data-driven problems in various domains.

## 💼 Experience
**Data Support and App Developer**  
Boccia Australia · Contract  
Jul 2024 - Present 
Melbourne, Victoria, Australia · Hybrid

Building on my previous internship at the Victorian Institute of Sport, where I developed an R Shiny application for Boccia, I am now enhancing the app to include Pairs match data analysis.

My responsibilities include expanding app functionalities, incorporating user feedback from coaches and athletes, and integrating Snowflake for scalable, high-performance data warehousing and analytics. This enables efficient data management, real-time insights, and secure data sharing across the team.

I am collaborating closely with analysts from the Australian Institute of Sport, Victorian Institute of Sport, and Paralympics Australia to ensure the app meets the highest standards of performance analysis.

**Data Science Intern**  
Victorian Institute of Sport · Internship  
Jul 2023 - Oct 2023 
Albert Park, Victoria, Australia · Hybrid

I helped develop an R Shiny application for athletes, coaches, and analysts in the Paralympic sport of Boccia. This app collects, aggregates, and analyzes performance data, providing a user-friendly interface to monitor metrics in real-time. Using R's data manipulation and visualization tools, I created interactive, filterable dashboards to support better decision-making and optimize training strategies, without the need to purchase expensive software solutions.
